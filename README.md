#  Fashion Finder

## OVERVIEW

**Fashion Finder** enables intelligent image and text-based search for fashion items using deep learning and vector similarity. The project integrates:

- A **CLIP-based** feature extractor for image/text understanding
- **Pinecone** for fast vector search and similarity retrieval
- **MongoDB/GridFS** for storing and serving fashion item images
- A clean **Flask** web interface for uploading images, entering text, or using a webcam

The system also performs **zero-shot classification** to filter out non-fashion-related inputs and ensure only relevant queries are processed.

---

##  Features

-  Search similar items using:
  -  Uploaded fashion images
  -  Text descriptions (e.g., "leather jacket", "floral dress")
  -  Webcam input
-  Fashion-relevance detection using CLIP zero-shot prompts
-  Fast top-k image retrieval via vector similarity (Pinecone)
-  GridFS-backed image serving from MongoDB
